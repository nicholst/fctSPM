Using spm1d package (v.0.4.3), computes ANOVA and post-hoc tests from anova1 to anova3rm, with a non-parametric approach (permutation tests).
The type of anova (if required) and post-hoc are choosen regarding the independant or repeated measure effects given in parameters.
The function automatically adapts to 1D and 2D data.

The general usage is:
```matlab
spmAnalysis=fctSPM(data, independantEffects, repeatedMeasuresEffects, varargin)
```

## Warnings ##
- Unbalanced two- and three-way repeated-measures ANOVA results have not been verified.
Example: more subjects in Group 1 than in Group 2.
Please interpret results for these designs with caution, and recognize that they might not be valid.
- Post-hoc tests with Bonferonni correction are only approximate.
- Somes warnings are displayed if the number of iterations is automatically modified or not sufficiant to perform the analysis with the defined alpha risk.
- Effect sizes and confidence intervals are not validated and are just given as supplementary information.
- For more information, please visit : https://spm1d.org/Documentation.html


### Caution ###
- Avoid the same typo (e.g., POST, POST2) for the effect names, it affects the recognition for the multiples comparisons 
- Avoid underscore (_) or minus (-) sign. Spaces are OK
- Use '/' when selecting a saving directory (`savedir` option)
- Once you are ok with the created figure, increase the number of iterations (`multiIT` or `IT` options) to achieve numerical stability. 1000 iterations are a good start but if your hardware allows it, the more is the better


## Statement of need ##
Most of physiological data measured during human movement are continuous and expressed in function of time. 
However, researchers predominantly analyze extracted scalar values from the continuous measurement, as the mean, the maximum, the amplitude, or the integrated value over the time. 
Analyzing continuous values (i.e., time series) can provide more information than extracted indicators, as the later discards one dimension of the data among the magnitude and localization in time. 
In addition, oscillatory signals such as muscle vibrations and electromyograms contain information in the temporal and frequency domains. 
Once again, scalar analysis reduces the information at only one dimension by discarding two dimensions among the magnitude and the localization in the time and/or frequency domain.

fctSPM allows MATLAB users to create figures of 1D and 2D SPM analysis for ANOVA and post-hoc designs.    
The statistical analysis is also saved in .mat files.   
This function synthetises the main and interaction effects to display only the significant post-hoc regarding the results of the ANOVA.   
For post-hoc for interaction effects, the main effect is also displayed if located elsewhere than the interaction effect.

### spmAnalysis ###
`spmAnalaysis.mat` is a structure composed of the results of teh statistical analysis (ANOVA + Post Hoc). 

`spmAnalysis.anova` is composed of different fields :  
* `type` is the type of ANOVA performed
* `effectNames` is a structure (one cell for each effect) that represent the names of the effects tested (mains and interactions)
* `alpha` is the alpha risk choosen for the anova (default is 0.05 (5%)).  
* `pCritical` is the alpha risk used for the anova. Warning message is displayed if this value is modified.
* `nIterations` is the number of iterations performed for the anova.
* `maxIterations` is the number of maximal iterations possible for the anova.
* `Fcontinuum` is a structure that represent the F-value for each node

* `clusterLocation` is a structure (one for each significant cluster) that contains the location (start and end as indexes) of each significant cluster.
* `clusterP` is a structure (one for each significant cluster) that contains the p-value of each significant cluster. 

`clusterLocation` and `clusterP` are created only in one dimension

`spmAnalysis.posthoc` is a strucure of cells (one for each effect of the ANOVA) composed of different fields :
* `data.names` is a structure that contains the name of the conditions used in the analysis (\cap is the union of different conditions for interactions).
* `data.continuum` is a structure that contains the data used in the analysis.

For the following outputs, the number of cells of the structure correspond to the number of t-tests performed, one t-test corresponds to one cell.
* `differences.names` is the name of the conditions (the first minus the second) used in the differences and t-tests.
* `differences.continuum` is the data used to plot differences.

* `tTests.names` is the name of the conditions (the first minus the second) used in the differences and t-tests.
* `tTests.nWarning` represents the number of warnings displayed during the analysis : 0 is OK, 1 means the number of iterations was reduced but `pCritical` = `pBonferroni`, 2 means that the number of iterations was reduced and `pCritical` > `pBonferroni`. In this case, more subjects are required to performed the analysis. %* `tTests.alpha` is the alpha risk choosen for the post hoc tests  before Bonferroni correction (default is the same as the ANOVA).

* `tTests.maxIterations` is the number of maximal iterations possible for the t-test.
* `tTests.Tcontinuum` represents the T-value for each node
* `tTests.Tthreshold` represents the statistical threshold for the T-values (statistical inference)
* `tTests.Tsignificant` contains the logical for the significance (Tcontinuum > Tthreshold) (1 if significant, 0 if not). This value is corrected with the result of the corresponding ANOVA and previous t-tests.

* `tTests.clusterLocation` is a structure (one for each significant cluster) that contains the location (start and end as indexes) of each significant cluster.
* `tTests.clusterP` is a structure (one for each significant cluster) that contains the p-value of each significant cluster. This value is corrected with inverse Bonferonni correction.
`clusterLocation` and `clusterP` are created only in one dimension and are not corrected with the result of the ANOVA.

`tTests.contourSignificant is created only in two dimensions.  


### Figures ###
Two folders composed of figures in `.TIF` and `.fig` are created

#### ANOVA ####
Each effect is also display on a specific figure in `.TIF` format named after `effectNames`, a floder named FIG is also created and contains the figures in `.fig` format.   
For 1D:  The curve represents the `Fcontinuum`, the horizontal line is the `Fthreshold`, the highlighted parts of the curve in blue represents the significant cluster(s), and the vertical lines are the start and end indexes.
For 2D: The map represents the `Fcontinuum`, with a colorbar maximum at `Fthreshold`, the white clusters represent the significant clusters.

#### Post Hoc ####
This folder contains additional folders (0 (for anova1), 3 (for anova2) or 7 (for anova3)) that contain figures and metrics representing the different post-hoc tests.  

Interaction folders (AxB or AxBxC) contain 2 or 3 folders in which one effect is investigated.

##### In one dimension #####
A total of 5 figures with the name of the effect represent the means and standard deviations between subject for each condition (grouped in fuction of the effect investigated).  
Under this plot, a second graph display the result of the ANOVA (or ANOVAs for interaction) and the significant post-hoc tests for pairewise comparisons.  
The differences between the 5 figures are the representation of the ANOVA and the disposition of the statistical analysis (subplot or same plot, see optional inputs)

Subfolders : Contains the pairewise comparison results 
* DIFF: Differences plots. Filenames with '%' at the end are the relative differences
* ES: Effect size plots. Bold blue lines are located at the significant differences (corrected with the ANOVA).
* SPM: Tcontinuum and statistical inferences plots. Bold blue lines are located at the significant differences (corrected with the ANOVA).
* FIG folder contains the above mentionned folder with the figures in `.fig` format.

##### In two dimensions #####
Means maps for each condition are represented in one figure each. 
The global effect of the post hoc precedure is display on a figure with the name of the effect. Mean maps are represented on the diagonal, pairewise differences on the top-right panel, and pairewise spm inferences on the bottom-left panel. 

Subfolders : Contains the pairewise comparison results (In one folder for ANOVA1, in 2 or 3 folders for ANOVA2 and ANOVA3)
* SD : standard deviation of the maps for each condition.
* DIFF: Differences plots. Filenames with '%' at the end are the relative differences. White clusters represent the significant effect (corrected with ANOVA)
* ES: Effect size plots. Whites clusters represent the significant effect (corrected with ANOVA)
* SPM: Tcontinuum and statistical inferences plots. Whites clusters represent the significant effect (no correction with the ANOVA)
* FIG folder contains the above mentionned folder with the figures in `.fig` format.

## Optional functions ##
in addition of `fctSPM`, this repository contains two similar funtions. 
*`fctSPMS` performs the same analysis than `fctSPM`, however, the figures are not ploted and saved. The inputs are the same at the exception that there is no savedir and no plot parameters.
*`saveNplot` permits to save and plot the analysis obtain with `fctSPM` and `fctSPMS`.

The general use of these funtion are :
```matlab
spmAnalysis=fctSPMS(data, independantEffects, repeatedMeasuresEffects, 'Optional Input Name', value)
saveNplot(spmAnalysis,'Optional Input Name', value)
```
It may be useful to use `saveNplot` when a 2D analysis is performed, it may permit to redo quickly figures without the long time of analysis. This function is less relevant in 1D as some of the plot can't be save. Besides, 1D analysis is shorter and there is only a little gain in time.
