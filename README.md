Using spm1d package (v.0.4.3), computes ANOVA and post-hoc tests from anova1 to anova3rm, with a non-parametric approach (permutation tests).
The type of ANOVA (if required) and post-hoc are chosen regarding the independent or repeated measure effects given in parameters.
The function automatically adapts to 1D and 2D data.

The general usage is:
```matlab
spmAnalysis=fctSPM(data, independantEffects, repeatedMeasuresEffects, varargin)
```

## Warnings ##
* Unbalanced two- and three-way repeated-measures ANOVA results have not been verified.
Example: more subjects in Group 1 than in Group 2.
Please interpret results for these designs with caution, and recognize that they might not be valid.
* Post-hoc tests with Bonferonni correction are only approximate and conservative. Refer to the [spm1d documentation about post hoc tests](https://spm1d.org/doc/PostHoc/anova.html) for more information.
* Some warnings are displayed if the number of permutations is automatically modified or not sufficient to perform the analysis with the defined alpha risk.
* Effect sizes and confidence intervals are not validated and are just given as supplementary information.
* For more information, please visit the [smp1d documentation](https://spm1d.org/Documentation.html)


### Caution ###
* For `independantEffects` and `repeatedMeasuresEffects`, avoid underscore (_) or minus (-) signs. Spaces are OK. It affects the recognition of sub-data for the multiples comparisons 
* Use '/' when indicating a saving directory (`savedir` option)
* Once you are ok with the created figure, increase the number of permutations (`multiPerm` or `Perm` options) to achieve numerical stability. 1000 permutations are a good start but if your hardware allows it, the more is the better


## Statement of need ##
Most of physiological data measured during human movement are continuous and expressed in function of time. 
However, researchers predominantly analyze extracted scalar values from the continuous measurement, as the mean, the maximum, the amplitude, or the integrated value over the time. 
Analyzing continuous values (i.e., time series) can provide more information than extracted indicators, as the later discards one dimension of the data among the magnitude and localization in time. 
In addition, oscillatory signals such as muscle vibrations and electromyograms contain information in the temporal and frequency domains. 
Once again, scalar analysis reduces the information at only one dimension by discarding two dimensions among the magnitude and the localization in the time and/or frequency domain.

Factorial SPM (fctSPM) allows MATLAB users to create figures of 1D and [2D SPM](https://spm1d.org/doc/Stats2D/ex2d_matlab.html) analysis for ANOVA and post-hoc designs.
The statistical analysis is also saved in `.mat` files.   
This function synthetizes the main and interaction effects to display only the significant post-hoc regarding the results of the ANOVA.   
For post-hoc for interaction effects, the main effect is also displayed if located elsewhere than the interaction effect.

* `data.names` is a structure that contains the name of the conditions used in the analysis (\cap is the union of different conditions for interactions).
* `data.continuum` is a structure that contains the data used in the analysis.

For the following outputs, the number of cells of the structure correspond to the number of t-tests performed, one t-test corresponds to one cell.

* `tTests.nWarning` represents the number of warnings displayed during the analysis: 0 is OK, 1 means the number of permutations was reduced but `pCritical` = `pBonferroni`, 2 means that the number of permutations was reduced and `pCritical` > `pBonferroni`. In this case, more subjects are required to performed the analysis. %* `tTests.alpha` is the alpha risk choosen for the post hoc tests before Bonferroni correction (default is the same as the ANOVA).

### Figures ###
Two folders composed of figures in `.TIF` and `.fig` are created

#### ANOVA ####
Each effect is also display on a specific figure in `.TIF` format named after `effectNames`, a floder named FIG is also created and contains the figures in `.fig` format.   
For 1D:  The curve represents the `Fcontinuum`, the horizontal line is the `Fthreshold`, the highlighted parts of the curve in blue represents the significant cluster(s), and the vertical lines are the start and end indexes.
For 2D: The map represents the `Fcontinuum`, with a colorbar maximum at `Fthreshold`, the white clusters represent the significant clusters.

#### Post Hoc ####
This folder contains additional folders (0 (for anova1), 3 (for anova2) or 7 (for anova3)) that contain figures and metrics representing the different post-hoc tests.  

Interaction folders (AxB or AxBxC) contain 2 or 3 folders in which one effect is investigated.

##### In one dimension #####
A total of 5 figures with the name of the effect represent the means and standard deviations between subject for each condition (grouped in function of the effect investigated).  
Under this plot, a second graph display the result of the ANOVA (or ANOVAs for interaction) and the significant post-hoc tests for pairwise comparisons.  
The differences between the 5 figures are the representation of the ANOVA and the disposition of the statistical analysis (subplot or same plot, see optional inputs)

Subfolders: Contains the pairwise comparison results 
* DIFF: Differences plots. Filenames with '%' at the end are the relative differences
* ES: Effect size plots. Bold blue lines are located at the significant differences (corrected with the ANOVA).
* SPM: Tcontinuum and statistical inferences plots. Bold blue lines are located at the significant differences (corrected with the ANOVA).
* FIG folder contains the above mentioned folder with the figures in `.fig` format.

##### In two dimensions #####
Means maps for each condition are represented in one figure each. 
The global effect of the post hoc procedure is display on a figure with the name of the effect. Mean maps are represented on the diagonal, pairwise differences on the top-right panel, and pairwise SPM inferences on the bottom-left panel. 

Subfolders: Contains the pairwise comparison results (In one folder for ANOVA1, in 2 or 3 folders for ANOVA2 and ANOVA3)
* SD: standard deviation of the maps for each condition.
* DIFF: Differences plots. Filenames with '%' at the end are the relative differences. White clusters represent the significant effect (corrected with ANOVA)
* ES: Effect size plots. Whites clusters represent the significant effect (corrected with ANOVA)

## Optional functions ##
in addition of `fctSPM`, this repository contains two similar funtions. 
*`fctSPMS` performs the same analysis than `fctSPM`, however, the figures are not ploted and saved. The inputs are the same at the exception that there is no savedir and no plot parameters.
*`saveNplot` permits to save and plot the analysis obtain with `fctSPM` and `fctSPMS`.

The general use of these funtion are:
```matlab
spmAnalysis=fctSPMS(data, independantEffects, repeatedMeasuresEffects, 'Optional Input Name', value)
saveNplot(spmAnalysis,'Optional Input Name', value)
```
It may be useful to use `saveNplot` when a 2D analysis is performed, it may permit to redo quickly figures without the long time of analysis.
